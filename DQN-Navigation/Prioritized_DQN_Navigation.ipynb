    "### 3. Introduction\n",
    "Prioritized DQN is one of the improvements over Double DQNs.It was first discussed on paper [Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952) which was introduced in 2015 by Tom Schaul. The basic idea is that some experiences may be more important than others for our training, but it might occur less frequently. Because we sample the batch randomly these rich experiences will rarely get selected or no chance to be selected. Hence, we add priority with each experience and sample based on priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Revisting the Double DQN algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "DQN algorithm attempts to find a policy $\\pi$ which maps a given state $s_t$ to an action at such that it maximizes the expected reward of the agent $\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\Big[ \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty r_t \\Big]$ from some starting state $s_0$. DQN obtains $\\pi$ implicitly by calculating a state-value function $Q_θ(s,a)$ parameterized by θ, which measures the goodness of the given state-action with respect to some behavioral policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find an appropriate θ, which then determines the final policy $\\pi$, DQN performs the following optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\n",
    "{\\rm minimize}_{\\theta} \\;\\; \\mathbb{E}_{(s_t,a_t,r_t,s_{t+1})\\sim D}\n",
    "\\left[\n",
    "\\Big(r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q_{\\theta^-}(s_{t+1},a) - Q_\\theta(s_t,a_t)\\Big)^2\n",
    "\\right]\n",
    "$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $(s_t,a_t,r_t,s_{t+1})$ are batches of samples from the replay buffer $D$, which is designed to store the past N samples. In addition, $A$ represents the set of discrete actions, θ is the local network and $\\theta^-$ represents the target network. Both networks use the same architecture, and we use $Q_θ(s,a)$ or $Q_{\\theta^-}(s,a)\n",
    "$ to denote which of the two is being applied to evaluate (s,a).\n",
    "\n",
    "The target network starts off by getting matched to the current network, but remains frozen (usually for thousands of steps) before getting updated again to match the network. The process repeats throughout training, with the goal of increasing the stability of the targets $r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}}Q_{\\theta^-}(s_{t+1},a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Temporal difference (or TD) error\n",
    "The difference between the estimated reward at any given state and the actual reward received. The larger the error function, the larger the difference between the expected and actual reward.\n",
    "TD Error for vanilla DQN:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\delta_i = r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} Q_{\\theta^-}(s_{t+1},a) -\n",
    "Q_\\theta(s_t,a_t)$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "and for Double-DQN:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\delta_i = r_t + \\gamma Q_{\\theta^-}(s_{t+1},{\\rm argmax}_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}}\n",
    "Q_\\theta(s_{t+1},a)) - Q_\\theta(s_t,a_t)$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the magnitude of the TD error $| \\delta_i |$. We can calculate the priority $p_i$ by adding $\\epsilon$ to TD error magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$p_i = | \\delta_i | + \\epsilon$    \n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is a small constant ensuring that the sample has some non-zero probability of being drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can’t do greedy prioritization, because it will lead to always training the same experiences (that have big priority), and then we'll be over-fitting our agent. So, we will use stochastic prioritization, which generates the probability of being chosen for a replay:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$P(i) = \\frac{p_i^a}{\\sum_k p_k^a}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $p_i$ - Priority value\n",
    "- $\\sum_k p_k^a$ - Normalization by all priority values in Replay Buffer\n",
    "- $𝑎$ - Hyperparameter used to reintroduce some randomness in the experience selection for the replay buffer (if a=0 pure randomness, if a=1 only selects the experience with the highest priorities)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can put this priority $P(i)$ in our replay buffer tuple $(s_{t},a_{t},r_{t},s_{t+1}, P(i))$. \n",
