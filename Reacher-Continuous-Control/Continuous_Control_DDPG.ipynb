    "### 3. Introduction\n",
    "After Deep Q-Networks became a hit, people realized that deep learning methods could be used to solve high-dimensional problems like continuous action spaces. This is a significant obstacle, since most interesting problems in robotic control, etc., fall into this category. Logically, if you discretize your continuous action space too finely, you end up with the same curse of dimensionality problem as before. On the other hand, a naive discretization of the action space throws away valuable information concerning the geometry of the action domain. So Google DeepMind has devised a solid algorithm for tackling the continuous action space problem. Building off the prior work of on Deterministic Policy Gradients, they have produced a policy-gradient actor-critic algorithm called [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) that is off-policy and model-free, and that uses some of the deep learning techniques that were introduced along with Deep Q-Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Algorithm overview\n",
    "At its core, DDPG is a policy gradient algorithm that uses a stochastic behavior policy for good exploration but estimates a deterministic target policy, which is much easier to learn. Policy gradient algorithms utilize a form of policy iteration: they evaluate the policy, and then follow the policy gradient to maximize performance. Since DDPG is off-policy and uses a deterministic target policy, this allows for the use of the Deterministic Policy Gradient theorem. DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm as well. it primarily uses two neural networks, one for the actor and one for the critic. These networks compute action predictions for the current state and generate a temporal-difference (TD) error signal each time step. The input of the actor network is the current state, and the output is a single real value representing an action chosen from a continuous action space. The critic’s output is simply the estimated Q-value of the current state and of the action given by the actor. The deterministic policy gradient theorem provides the update rule for the weights of the actor network. The critic network is updated from the gradients obtained from the TD error signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Model Architecture\n",
    "DDPG uses four neural networks: \n",
    "1. A Q network \n",
    "2. A deterministic policy network, \n",
    "3. A target Q network\n",
    "4. A target policy network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q network and policy network is very much like simple Advantage Actor-Critic, but in DDPG, the Actor directly maps states to actions (the output of the network directly the output) instead of outputting the probability distribution across a discrete action space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target networks are time-delayed copies of their original networks that slowly track the learned networks. Using these target value networks greatly improve stability in learning.\n",
    "So, we have the standard Actor & Critic architecture for the deterministic policy network and the Q network"

During each trajectory roll-out, we save all the experience tuples (state, action, reward, next_state) and store them in a finite-sized cache — a “replay buffer.” Then, we sample random mini-batches of experience from the replay buffer when we update the value and policy networks.\n",
